👋 Hi, I’m Anton.

This GitHub is not a portfolio.  
Not a résumé.  
Not a “hire me pls” page.

It’s a playground 🧪

Here I:
- test ideas
- break things
- try weird approaches
- experiment with tech I’m curious about

Some repos are unfinished.  
Some are messy.  
Some exist just because I wanted to see *what happens if…*

If you’re looking for perfection — this is the wrong place.  
If you’re curious how things work — welcome.

Use, explore, ignore. All good.
